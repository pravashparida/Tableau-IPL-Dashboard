# Ipl_Case_Study

Problem Statement
You work as a data analyst at IFP, a nationally recognised news agency, which is based out of New Delhi, and provides news reports and feeds to magazines, newspapers and TV broadcasters all over the country. The Sports Editor of the agency has approached you to build a Tableau dashboard of IPL statistics over the years since its inception in order to create an infographic for a newsletter that their team is working on. For this newsletter, in some cases, they will use the visual representations as you have created in Tableau directly for their infographic, and in a few other cases, they will use important statistics after trying out the different filters and customisations that you have provided for interactivity. Therefore, you are expected to build an interactive dashboard in Tableau for this purpose. Letâ€™s watch the upcoming video and listen to Shreyas as he states the broad objective of this assignment.

In order to complete this assignment, you need to use the following two data set files:

matches.csv - It contains match-level information for each and every match held in IPL from 2008 to 2017.
deliveries.csv - It contains ball-by-ball information for each of the matches.

Combining the information in these two data sets, you will be creating an interactive dashboard that highlights some of the important statistics of IPL over the years. You will learn more about the datasets in one of the videos below.
